# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
game over method
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would make the computer play counter plays to the player based on whereever the player moves and make sure the player never wins and cats in the worst case scenario

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

There are very specific boxes that you can or cannot move after the first move. If the player moves in one of those specific boxes, I would make the computer move to a certain box after and after until they tie or win.
